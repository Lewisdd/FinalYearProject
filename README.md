To run the program, extract the JAR file into its own folder. If the data used for the results is wanted it can also be extracted into the same folder as the JAR. Run the JAR file and the network menu will show up.

Training a new network:

Input the variables you want to test as shown in section 5.3.1 and click the "Train New Network" button. 

The process will freeze for the time taken to create and train the network. This time taken is heavily based on the generation count used. After a while, the display will show.

Loading a Network

Click the drop down and select the network you wish to view. Click the "Load Neural Network" button and the display will show.

Running via source files

Compile the code and run the Simulater.java class.
